# Automatic Eye Movement Controlled Wheelchair

This is my capstone project towards my Bachelor's degree during Spring 2018. 
Developed a prototype of a wheelchair which is controlled automatically by tracking eye movement and IR sensors.
MATLAB was used to process the eye images and determine the direction
Arduino was used as the controller to control a wheelchair prototype.
